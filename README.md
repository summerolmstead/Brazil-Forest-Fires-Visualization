# Brazil-Forest-Fires-Visualization
With a time series data set of Brazil forest fires from 1998 to 2016 and a geospatial Brazillian State file, we can visualize by the amount of fires in each state with a geospatial visualization in the year 2016. This project does two different visualizations which includes a static map and an interactive map with the use of the Plotly python library.
